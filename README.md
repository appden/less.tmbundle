# LESS TextMate bundle

Syntax highlighting for `.less` files. To learn more about [LESS][], see <http://lesscss.org/docs.html>.

This bundle was forked from `appden/less.tmbundle` but has since been rewritten from scratch (the language syntax).

[`sample.less`](http://github.com/rsms/less.tmbundle/blob/master/sample.less):

## Installation

Copy and paste this line into your shell:

```
git clone https://github.com/appden/less.tmbundle.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/less.tmbundle
```

## Compiling to CSS (âŒ˜B)

Runs `lessc` on the current file, saving to the same file name with a .css extension (e.g. style.less => style.css). When there is `lessc: somefile.less` somewhere in the current file, that file is compiled instead.

Compiling requires some version of `lessc` to be in your `PATH`.
